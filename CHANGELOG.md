# 4.0.0
The MCP Bridge Server component has now been removed from this package and
moved into its own package [a2a_mcp_bridge](https://pub.dev/packages/a2a_mcp_bridge).
Although a useful component of the Dart A2A ecosystem it is not a core
component of A2A itself.
Users of the bridge server should now include the a2a_mcp_bridge package along with
a2a.
